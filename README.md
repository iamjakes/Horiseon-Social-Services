# Description 
With this website I have reviewed and improved the code associated with the website to be more accessible. In the improved code you will find reworked CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organized to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page. These improvements will very much make the page much more accessible.
